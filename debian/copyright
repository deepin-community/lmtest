This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-lmtest package of lmtest, a
collection of tests, data sets and examples for diagnotic checking in
linear regression models. The lmtest package was written by Torsten
Hothorn, Achim Zeileis and David Mitchell.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'lmtest' to 'r-cran-lmtest'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
